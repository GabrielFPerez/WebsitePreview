	<h2> Learn the Truth </h2> 
	<p> What do you truly know about video games and a child's connection to them? Growing up, video games have always been a part of my life from brick breaker on the old BlackBerry Curve, to Elden Ring on the PC. They have been around for a long time and for a good reason. Video games are so accessible to any gender and age. No matter what you enjoy doing there is a game for you. Personally, I like first person shooters whereas my girlfriend could not care less about them. However, if you show her a game where you just have to build a bridge to get across the gap, she would be happy. This just shows how games work no matter your interests. All you need is your imagination and the game, and you can have a wonderful experience. Everyone deserves this and I want parents to see how they can help support their childâ€™s experience. Welcome to Behind the Controller.
