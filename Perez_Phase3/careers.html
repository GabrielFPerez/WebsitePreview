	<h2> Career Opportunities </h2> 
	<p> Parents, I want to urge you to watch your kids and try and understand the level of their skill. Nowadays Esports is on the rise and if you see a rising star in your child then you should do what you can to help them improve. I follow a few different people in the competitive game industry and while it is rare, some of them can make good careers out of it. I know of one twitch streamer who is also a professional Fortnite player who is seventeen and already a millionaire. This is why I stress it for parents to support their kids because if they have a natural talent for games and they love them then why not make money off of it? It also does not have to be Esports if they want to game. If you want, you could introduce them to streaming if you find them very entertaining. There are countless opportunities in the video game industry and there will be even more as time goes on.
