	<h2> The Mission </h2> 
	<p> Video games has always been one of the most interesting concepts to me ever since I was a kid. The fact companies could create a world completely different from ours and that we could enter it was just fascinating to me. These games helped me get through my childhood and helped me connect to the lifelong friends I have made. The problem I want to address is the negative feelings some people hold towards them. Now I know everyone has their own opinions, but I want people to stop accusing video games of having only adverse effects on kids. They can have major benefits if used correctly. But kids should still be monitored when playing games and should not be able to play any game they want. It still needs to be age appropriate. However, I want to recommend a specific way of regulating games. I believe parents should sit down with their kids and try to learn the games with them. It could help them understand where their kids come from and help them bond. Growing up my parents did not care much for games, so they generally opted out of playing videogames. Which was fine but if they had played, I know I would have had a lot more fun when I was younger. I also was the only person in my family to love videogames, so I had to use my imagination to create a world inside my head that placed me in the games. I had a lot of fun doing this because it made me view these things as amazing which led me towards my love for technology. Technology showed me your imagination can be brought to life as long as you think big enough. In the end all I want is for parents and others to understand that video games can mean more to kids than they know. Sometimes you cannot always pause the game, and I want parents to learn to be understanding that if their child is taking the time to play a game and get good at it, then they should respect it. Every craft deserves respect from everyone.</p>
